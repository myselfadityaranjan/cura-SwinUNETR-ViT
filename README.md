This is the BraTS 2021 Task 1 Dataset

To Train the model, I used the "BraTS2021_Training_Data"
The other 2 subdirectories should be used for testing

Before running, make sure that this dataset is installed and in your main project directory
Make sure the names and paths of the data directories match up in your code and directory structure
Also make sure you have 2 additional output directories: one for models, and one more for processed data
