All files contained in this dataset are compressed NIFTI files (i.e. .nii.gz). It is not necessary to convert them into (.nii) files. Leave them as .nii.gz when downloading and expanding the zip archive from the link. 

To Train the model, I used the "BraTS2021_Training_Data"
The other 2 subdirectories should be used for testing
